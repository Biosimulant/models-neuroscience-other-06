# models-neuroscience-other-06

Curated collection of **neuroscience SBML/CellML** models (Part 6 of 7) for the **biosim** platform. This repository contains 392 neuroscience models from BioModels and other curated databases, including neural dynamics, neurotransmitter systems, and brain metabolism.

## What's Inside

### Models (392 packages)

**Neuroscience SBML/CellML** — brain metabolism, neurotransmitter dynamics, and neural signaling:

**Model Types:** Neurotransmitter synthesis and release, synaptic plasticity models, brain energy metabolism, neuronal calcium dynamics, and disease models (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's). All models use SBML/CellML format executed via tellurium runtime.

**Repository Note:** This is **part 6 of 7** neuroscience-other repositories (split for size management).
