description: "{\"value\": \"\\\"To circumvent the many problems in teaching neurophysiology as a \\u201cwet lab,\\u201d we developed SWIMMY, a virtual fish that swims by moving its virtual tail by means of a virtual neura. It can be used to explore neural activity dynamics and compare response patterns across conditions."
