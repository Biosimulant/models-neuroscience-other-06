# Space Prompt - neuroscience-general-combo-0039

Create a scientifically coherent **neuroscience / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: neuroscience-other-models-for-diotic-and-dichotic-detection-davidso-126636-model, neuroscience-other-models-of-na-channels-from-a-paper-on-the-pkc-co-85112-model, neuroscience-other-models-of-vector-navigation-with-grid-cells-bush-182685-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
