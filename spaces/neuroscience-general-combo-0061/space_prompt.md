# Space Prompt - neuroscience-general-combo-0061

Create a scientifically coherent **neuroscience / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: neuroscience-other-oscillation-and-coding-in-a-proposed-nn-model-of-123986-model, neuroscience-other-oscillations-emerging-from-noise-driven-nns-tchu-168599-model, neuroscience-other-oversampling-method-to-extract-excitatory-and-in-145803-model, neuroscience-other-oxytocin-and-vip-involvement-in-prolactin-secret-91893-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
