# Space Prompt - neuroscience-cortical-circuits-combo-0021

Create a scientifically coherent **neuroscience / cortical_circuits** comparative space using:
- Base models: neuroscience-other-scaling-self-organizing-maps-to-model-large-cort-76883-model, neuroscience-other-schiz-linked-gene-effects-on-intrinsic-single-ne-169457-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
