title: 'Neuroscience: Cortical Circuits (COMBO_0021)'
description: "Neuroscience Cortical Circuits (COMBO_0021) brings together scaling_self_1, schiz_linked_2, state_compare_mon in a comparative space to examine how cortical circuit motifs transform and propagate activity. When you run it, you can compare participant trajectories through shared runtime settings and routed output streams."

scientific_context:
  question: How do cortical circuit motifs transform and propagate activity?
  mode: comparative
  assumptions:
  - Model implementations are used as published in their curated manifests without
    biological reinterpretation.
  - Time integration uses a shared global tick compatible with model min_dt constraints.
  - Comparative (non-causal) mode is used because full deterministic IO coverage for
    causal coupling was not satisfied.
  expected_observables:
  - Model output trajectories under shared runtime settings.
  - Cross-model agreement/divergence in key state or metric signals.
  - Relative behavior comparison without causal linkage claims.
  limitations:
  - No new biology is introduced beyond what upstream models encode.
  - Cross-model semantic matching is rule-based and may under-connect uncertain routes.

  visualization_rationale: A dedicated monitor model receives all participating model
    state streams (`state_a..state_d`) so trajectories can be compared in one place
    without claiming causal coupling when IO semantics are incomplete.
