# Space Prompt - neuroscience-general-combo-0045

Create a scientifically coherent **neuroscience / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: neuroscience-other-myelinated-nerve-fibre-myelin-resistance-depende-136296-model, neuroscience-other-neocort-pyramidal-cells-subthreshold-somatic-vol-136309-model, neuroscience-other-network-bursts-in-cultured-nn-result-from-differ-150437-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
